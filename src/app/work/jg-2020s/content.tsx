        <p>After a major design and codebase overhaul (see my <Link href="/work/jg-2010s">2015 
           case study</Link>), the groundwork had been laid to start realizing bigger goals for 
           japan-guide.com. We‚Äôd made major strides in UX and development, but there was still work 
           to do. JG still needed a <strong>mobile-friendly, modern design</strong>, more <strong>intuitive 
           navigation</strong>, and <strong>faster page speeds</strong> for travelers from around 
           the world.</p>
        <p>My main role at JG was to make those things happen.</p>
        <p>This case study highlights some of my key efforts over my last 5 years at Japan Guide as  
           our team‚Äôs sole product designer and developer to make the site‚Äôs user experience 
           delightful, fast, and competitive with big name competitors.</p>

        <p>Creating responsive designs for over 2,000 pages of desktop-optimized content was no 
           small task. But with over 50% of JG‚Äôs users accessing the site on mobile devices when we 
           launched our first fully responsive version in 2017, the effort was worth it.</p>
        <p>I adapted hundreds of components and layout designs to fit any and all screen sizes. I 
           also made sure my changes had <strong><u>zero</u> impact on SEO</strong>, accessibility,
           or ad spaces.</p>

        <p>Japan Guide‚Äôs content is highly structured, but most sessions begin with visitors 
           landing deep within the site from Google search results. Helping users <strong>orient 
           and navigate quickly</strong> ‚Äî on any device ‚Äî was vital.</p>
        <p>We tried out multiple navigation experiences over the years. One notable attempt was 
           the ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù menu (2019‚Äì2022). This app-within-an-app concept was highly
           interactive and made exploring the site extremely fast. Ultimately, though, analytics 
           showed that always-visible, top-of-the-page sectional nav menus were more effective at 
           boosting discoverability.</p>

        <p>JG was maturing, accumulating components, new designs, and complexity. But without a 
           design system in place, <em>consistently</em> applying colors, typography, spacing, and 
           all the design decisions that make a solid UX, was becoming a sisyphean task.</p>
        <p>So, I created a <strong>design system</strong> for JG ‚Äî a framework for standardizing, 
           naming, and applying styles in both designs and code. I also created ‚ÄúJG Docs,‚Äù 
           a <strong>living documentation resource</strong> directly linked to our codebase, to 
           provide a single source of truth for our writers, videographers, and myself.</p>

        <p>Making a legacy website fully responsive isn‚Äôt (just) about rewriting CSS. To transform

        <ul>
          <li>Restructured hundreds of templates to support mobile-friendly CSS and JS</li>
          <li>Implemented a modular, SASS-based design system built on a modified BEM methodology</li>
          <li>Optimized page load speed with responsive image components, fine-tuned CSS and JS bundling, 
              and lazy loading techniques</li>
          <li>Ensured wide browser support, including IE11 (until 2022)</li>

        <p>I used a range of techniques to implement the ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù menu‚Äôs interactive design while 
           keeping loading times snappy. After downloading and caching a JSON data file on page 
           load, the menu was built in JavaScript, loading the current section‚Äôs data via a 
           depth-first search of the section data. The zoom level and positioning of the mini 
           Japan SVG maps were calculated dynamically.</p>

        <p>To implement our new design system, I needed a single source of truth in the codebase. 
           Being the late 2010s when I began to build out the system, I leaned heavily on SASS, 
           adding in CSS custom properties as browser support improved.</p>
        <p>To make our living documentation system, I used a Node.js-based build process to parse 
           the SASS maps containing design system values to create a JSON equivalent. This allowed 
           us to have up-to-date docs that always reflected exactly the same values being used on 
           the site.</p>
