          <p>When I joined <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">japan-guide.com</a> in 
             2014, the site held top-ranked Google search results for a huge range of Japan travel 
             keywords (Tokyo, Kyoto, Mt. Fuji, bullet train...), attracting 2M+ unique monthly 
             users on average.</p>
          <p>But that level of success doesnâ€™t sustain itself. Approaching the 2020s, we had made 
             major strides in UX and development, but we still had work to do. JG still needed 
             a <strong>mobile-friendly, modern design</strong>, more <strong>intuitive 
             navigation</strong>, and <strong>faster page speeds</strong> for travelers from around 
             the world.</p>
          <p>My main role at JG was to make those things happen.</p>
