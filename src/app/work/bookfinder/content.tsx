      text: <>
        <p>While deciding how to build the app, I focused on the client‚Äôs key requirements:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Defining and managing search queries in UI</li>
          <li>Scraping data from target sites on an automated schedule</li>
          <li>Processing and storing search results in a database</li>
          <li>Viewing, sorting, filtering, and saving listings via UI</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After researching different approaches and tech stacks, I decided to build the app as 
           a <strong>cloud-based web app</strong> using the <strong>Google Firebase</strong> platform 
           with a <strong>React front end.</strong> Firebase‚Äôs managed backend infrastructure was a 
           big time saver, freeing me to focus more on the app‚Äôs business logic and UI.</p>
        <p>To handle the searches, I used Google Cloud Functions with Node.js scripts tailored for 
           each target site. This approach worked well with a Firestore DB and made it easy to 
           reliably automate over 20,000 daily network requests and process and store the collected 
           data, all with minimal config.</p>
        <p>For the browser-based frontend, I used React to implement the high level of
           interactivity and customization needed for the UI. I reached for TanStack Query and 
           React Router to help simplify tasks like data fetching, state management, and 
           navigation, and Vite for development and bundling.</p>
